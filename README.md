# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:
To Design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study

## Algorithm:

Start

Define the design objective — create a fun, energetic food brand identity targeting Gen Z audiences.

Select brand colors — choose red (energy, appetite) and cream (warmth, comfort).

Choose typography — rounded and bold to reflect a youthful, friendly tone.

Design logo structure:

Place “Munch Up” at the center inside a circular frame.

Add small dessert illustrations on both sides for visual balance.

Insert tagline “GEN Z FOOD REVOLUTION” below for identity clarity.

Apply Gestalt principles:

Proximity: Group related elements like text and illustrations close together.

Similarity: Maintain consistent font and color styling.

Figure–Ground: Use a cream circle against a red background for focus.

Closure: Complete the composition within the circular boundary.

Develop mobile and web layouts:

Add logo and navigation bar (Home, Menu, Cart).

Include a large hero section with call-to-action button (“Order Now” or “Explore Menu”).

Display food categories in a grid layout with clear spacing.

Design a smooth checkout page with easy form fields.

Incorporate usability and UI patterns:

Maintain consistent button colors (red for action, cream for neutral).

Use simple icons and readable fonts for clarity.

Ensure responsive behavior across devices.

Test interaction behavior:

Conduct A/B testing with two design versions (different CTA button colors or placements).

Analyze user responses and choose the layout with higher engagement.

Refine and finalize design:

Adjust alignment, contrast, and readability.

Export logo and layouts in suitable formats (PNG, SVG, JPG).

End.
